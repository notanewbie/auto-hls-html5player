# videojs-auto-hls
Embeddible HLS player that works in all browsers. in those not supporting HLS, it automatically uses Video.js. To use, merely embed the file hls.html using &lt;iframe> like so:
<br />
&lt;iframe src="hls.html?[URL]">&lt;/iframe>
<br />
This lets you embed HLS streams and run it, even locally, without "cannot load blob resource" errors and the like. With this player, there will be no need to use Flash in order to garruntee universal browser support.
